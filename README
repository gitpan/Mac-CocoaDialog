Mac-CocoaDialog version 0.0.1

This module eases calls to the CocoaDialog program in Mac. Be sure to
look at CocoaDialog’s documentation at <http://cocoadialog.source‐
forge.net/> to see what’s this all about. Briefly speaking, CocoaDialog
gives you the possibility to let the user interact with a very basic
GUI, providing basic input boxes, progress bars, etc.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Alternatively, to install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


DEPENDENCIES

None, but it's pretty unuseful without CocoaDialog somewhere in your Mac
system.
